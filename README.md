## davereader package

It's the core of River5, without the top level. Can be used to build all kinds of feed-based apps.

### How to install

`npm install davereader`

### Story

Here's the story.

I've always wanted to have a package that made it possible to write quick apps that do stuff with RSS.

I write them all the time, but I always have to start over from the beginning, create a parser, then catch the new items as they come in, and do whatever it is I have to do, usually move the bits to another service like Twitter, or Slack or whatever. There are so many possible applications. 

When I was doing this, I realized I was solving a problem that was already solved, in my River software, but it wasn't configured correctly to make this easy. It was faster just to crib the code and start from scratch.

Finally, I have it set up so that this works. So the beauty in this is in the apps, not the engine. It's a solved problem that can now be used to solve new problems.
